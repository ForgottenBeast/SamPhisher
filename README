Run script/phisher_server.pl --port [port number] to test the application.

This is a very *VERY* simple phishing server. 

you can modify the login page by editing it or replacing it with another one
with the same name (root/autorisation.tt), just make sure that the fields for
login have the same names in your new page (login and pw).

also you should put the css and js files inside the root/static folder and
make the needed modification inside your new autorisation.tt





you can change pretty much anything regarding your "login" page,

-the favicon: in the html header add the following line:
<link rel="icon" href="/static/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />

and put your favicon.ico file in the root/static directory.


There also is a testemail html file in the application folder, to give you stats
on how many people opened the email in the first place it will load a one pixel
transparent png inside the mail cient, thus giving you their IP and time when
they decided to open the email.

the second piece of data you get is when they click on the link, you will have a
timestamp and ip address from which they accessed the web page

last thing if they do enter their credentials you will also store that.
